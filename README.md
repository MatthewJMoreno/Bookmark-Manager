# Bookmark-Manager

The purpose of this project is to improve user experience related to managing bookmarks.

## Short Term
The short term goal is to have a sidebar that appears with your current bookmarks. You'll be able to interact with it and have options such as dragging and dropping bookmarks
into other folders, creating new folders and changing the default manilla folder icon with your own images.
